This is an application to sort waste items that uses the jquery library. 
For the database, Google Sheets is used 
The user can input a waste item of his/her choice and the program will output the correct waste bin as well as some specifications 
and helpful facts to know
There is also a quiz section where users can test their knowledge on recycling.
Another feature includes the symbols guide, where users can click on a recycling symbol (found on nearly all items) to see what it means 
There is a suggestions page where the user can input an item they would like to see in the database that isn't already there.
